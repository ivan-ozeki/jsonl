Without in any way limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event the covenant not to compete contained herein, in the view of a court or arbitrator asked to rule upon the issue, is deemed unenforceable by reason of covering too large an area, too long a period of time or too many business activities, then the same shall be deemed to cover only the largest area, the longest time period or the most business activities, as the case may be, which will not render it unenforceable. In the event in any proceeding, a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants deemed included in this Section 9, then such unenforceable covenants shall be deemed deleted from this Section 9 to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced. 9.5 Covenants Reasonable. <del>Executive</del>  <ins>Employee</ins> agrees that the covenants provided for in this Section 9, including the term and geographical area encompassed therein, are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the Company in the conduct of its businesses and the utilization of the Proprietary Information of the Company, including good will. <ins>11 10.

The term \"engaging in competition\" as used herein shall be deemed to be used in its ordinary meaning and sense and shall include engaging in, assisting or have an interest in, or entering the employment of or acting as an agent, advisor or consultant for, any person or entity which is engaged in, or will be engaged in, the development, manufacture, supplying or sale of a product, process, service or development which is competitive with a product, process, service or development on which American Rebel has expended resources and on which <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> worked or with respect to which <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> has or had access to Confidential Information while at Company. Upon the Effective Date, <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> agrees that the geographical scope of this covenant not to compete shall be North America. 9.2 Acknowledgment Regarding Restrictions. <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> recognizes and agrees that the restraints contained in Section 9.1, including the geographic scope thereof in light of American Rebel's marketing efforts, are reasonable and enforceable in view of American Rebel's legitimate interests in protecting its Confidential Information and customer goodwill and the limited scope of the restrictions in Section 9.1. 9.3 Enforcement in Equity. <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> acknowledges and agrees that in the event that there is a breach of the covenant not to compete or of the non-solicitation covenant set forth herein, that American Rebel has no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that American Rebel may enforce these covenants in equity by way of injunctive relief, both temporary and permanent. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such actions shall be the District Court of Davidson County, Tennessee and <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of that court for such purposes. American Rebel shall not be deemed stopped from combining a claim for injunctive relief with a claim for money damages in the same action. In the event that American Rebel is the prevailing party in any such action, they shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorney's fees as part of the judgment in the action. 9.4 Non-Solicitation; Agreement not to Hire/be Hired. <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> understands and appreciates that American Rebel invests a tremendous amount of time, energy, resources and expertise in the training and education of its employees to be able to operate its operations. Further, <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> understands that in the event an employee of American Rebel or any of its operating subsidiaries, is enticed to leave, then American Rebel shall be damaged in an amount the Parties are not capable of calculating at the present time. Therefore, <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> agrees, that during any non-compete period set forth above and continuing for an additional six (6) month period, that he will not offer employment or contractor status to any employee or contractor or affiliated person of American Rebel, or accept employment or contractor status from any employee or contractor or affiliated person of American Rebel or its operating subsidiaries, nor to allow any person or entity affiliated with <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> to offer such employment status with <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> or any other concern, venture or entity with whom <del>Ross</del>  <ins>Grau</ins> may be employed by, associated or hold a more than five percent (5%) ownership position in.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/american-rebel-holdings-inc-8383/contract/162027/#clause-id-37112"}]}
