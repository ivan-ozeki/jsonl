{"clause_number": "Clause 12", "title": "Introduction", "text": "Introduction. The Compensation Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of Walker & Dunlop, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) adopted the Company\u2019s Management Deferred Stock Unit Purchase Matching Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), effective January 10, 2013 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d) to make matching awards covering shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cStock\u201d), in connection with Stock purchases made by eligible executives and its Affiliates under the Walker & Dunlop, Inc. Management Deferred Stock Unit Purchase Plan (the \u201cPurchase Plan\u201d). The Program was originally established under the Walker & Dunlop, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201c2010 Plan\u201d) and shall continue under the Walker & Dunlop, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as may be amended from time to time, the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d), which is an amendment and restatement of the 2010 Plan. Unless otherwise defined in the Program, capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth in the 2015 Plan. (b)        Purpose of the Program. Eligible executives who purchase shares of Stock under the Purchase Plan will automatically receive an award of Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units under the Program (as described in Section 4(f)). A \u201cRestricted Stock Unit\u201d is a right to receive one share of Stock subject to terms and conditions, such as a time-based vesting condition. A \u201cDeferred Stock Unit\u201d is a right to receive one share of Stock, which provides for delivery of the underlying share of Stock after the date of vesting, at a time or times consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all regulations, guidance, and other interpretive authority issued thereunder (collectively, \u201cSection 409A\u201d). Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units are referred to together as \u201cStock Units.\u201d \t\t \t\t \t\t\t2. ADMINISTRATION; AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION \t\t \t\t \t\t\t(a)         The Committee. The Program will be administered under the supervision of the Committee. The Committee will prescribe guidelines and forms for the implementation and administration of the Program, interpret the terms of the Program, and make all other substantive decisions regarding the operation of the Program. The Committee\u2019s decisions in its administration of the Program are final, binding, and conclusive on all persons. (b)        Amendment and Termination. The Committee may amend, suspend, or terminate the Program at any time and for any reason. No amendment, suspension, or termination will, without the consent of the Participant (as defined below), impair rights or obligations under any Stock Units previously awarded to the Participant under the Program. 1  \t\t    \t\t \t\t \t\t\t4. PROGRAM AWARDS \t\t \t\t \t\t\t(a)         Matching Award. Subject to Section 4(b), each Participant will automatically receive an award of Stock Units equal to 50% of the Deferred Stock Units purchased by the Participant under the Purchase Plan, rounded down to the nearest whole Stock Unit (the \u201cMatching Award\u201d). No fractional Stock Units will be awarded. The Matching Award will be determined on the date that the Participant\u2019s annual incentive bonus and/or Eligible Sales Commissions (the \u201cBonus\u201d) are paid (the \u201cAward Date\u201d). \u201cEligible Sales Commissions\u201d are the sales commissions for the calendar year that exceed the minimum established by the Company in an individual\u2019s Election Agreement (as defined below) and include only sales commissions the individual actually receives by December 31 of the calendar year in which the sales commissions are earned. For purposes of a Bonus that consists of Eligible Sales Commissions, the Eligible Sales Commissions shall be treated as paid in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Eligible Sales Commissions are earned and on the same Award Date as a Bonus that consists of an annual incentive bonus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of Stock Units with respect to a Matching Award that a Participant will receive on an Award Date equals $500,000 divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Award Date, rounded down to the nearest whole Stock Unit. The Stock Units granted with respect to the Matching Award will be credited to a bookkeeping account established and maintained for the Participant (an \u201cAccount\u201d). (b)        Condition to Receipt of Matching Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Program, in the event that the Participant\u2019s actual Bonus (i) for purposes of a Bonus that consists of an annual incentive bonus, is less than 51% of such Participant\u2019s target annual incentive bonus for a calendar year under the applicable incentive arrangement with the Company or any Affiliate or (ii) for purposes of a Bonus that consists of Eligible Sales Commissions, is equal to or less than the  Eligible Sales Commissions threshold (as that threshold is set by the Company or an Affiliate in the applicable agreement designating the individual as eligible to participate in the Plan), the Participant will not receive a Matching Award with respect to such calendar year. (c)         Vesting of the Matching Award; Forfeiture. Subject to the Participant\u2019s continued Service from the Award Date through the vesting date, the Matching Award will vest in full on March 15 of the third calendar year following the Award Date (the \u201cVesting Date\u201d). The Participant will automatically forfeit to the Company all of the unvested Stock Units in his or her Account underlying Matching Awards made to the Participant under the Program on the date of the Participant\u2019s termination of Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing vesting schedule, the Stock Units will become 100% vested upon the termination of the Participant\u2019s Service due to the Participant\u2019s death or Disability. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing vesting schedule and provided that the Participant\u2019s Service continues from the Award Date through the consummation of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 4(g)), the Stock Units will become 100% vested (i) if the Stock Units are not assumed, or equivalent awards are not substituted for the Stock Units, by the Company or its successor, or (ii) if assumed or substituted for, upon the Participant\u2019s involuntary dismissal by the Company or its successor for reasons other than Cause, or the Participant\u2019s voluntary resignation for Good Reason (as defined below), provided that such termination is effective within 24 months following the Change in Control. For purposes of the Program, \u201cGood Reason\u201d will have the meaning assigned to such term in any applicable written employment or severance agreement, plan, or arrangement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant, or if none, means the occurrence of one or more of the following without the Participant\u2019s express written consent: (A) the assignment of substantial duties or responsibilities inconsistent with the Participant\u2019s position at the Company or an Affiliate, or any other action by the Company or an Affiliate that results in a substantial diminution of the Participant\u2019s duties or responsibilities; (B) a requirement that the Participant work principally from a location outside the 20-mile radius from the Company\u2019s or the Affiliate\u2019s principal place of business; or (C) a substantial reduction in the Participant\u2019s aggregate base salary and other compensation taken as a whole, excluding any reductions caused by the failure to achieve \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t   \t\t  \t\t\t2  \t\t    \t\t \t\t \t\t\tperformance targets. To qualify as a voluntary resignation for Good Reason, the Participant must (I) provide notice to the Company or the Affiliate of any of the foregoing occurrences within 90 days of the initial occurrence, and the Company or the Affiliate will have 30 days to remedy such occurrence, and (II) terminate the Participant\u2019s Service at a time agreed reasonably with the Company or the Affiliate, but in any event within 120 days from the initial occurrence of any of the foregoing events. (d)        Election. In connection with the Participant\u2019s purchase of Deferred Stock Units under the Purchase Plan, each Participant will file a completed Bonus Deferral Election Agreement or Sales Commission Deferral Election Agreement (each, an \u201cElection Agreement\u201d) with the Company, on a form prescribed by the Committee, during the Open Enrollment Period. For purposes of the Plan, \u201cOpen Enrollment Period\u201d means (i) the period of time beginning on December 1 and ending on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year for which a Bonus is earned, or (ii) if otherwise determined by the Committee or an officer of the Company designated by the Committee, a period of 30 consecutive days ending no later than December 31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year for which a Bonus is earned. For purposes of a Bonus that consists of Eligible Sales Commissions, the Bonus is treated as earned in the calendar year in which the transaction giving rise to the sales commission is rate locked and delivered to the investor. The \u201cElection Date\u201d is the last day of the Open Enrollment Period of the applicable calendar year. (e)         Distribution Election; Issuance of Shares. The Election Agreement for each Participant will specify a distribution date for Deferred Stock Units purchased under the Purchase Plan (the \u201cDistribution Date\u201d), which Distribution Date will also apply to the Stock Units awarded under the Program. Any election of a Distribution Date is irrevocable as of the Election Date. The Company will issue to the Participant one share of Stock for each vested Stock Unit on the Distribution Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if the Distribution Date for a Stock Unit is the effective date of the Participant\u2019s Separation from Service from the Company, and on the date of the Participant\u2019s Separation from Service, the Participant is a \u201cspecified employee\u201d within the meaning of Section 409A, the shares will be issued on the later to occur of (A) the scheduled Distribution Date and (B) the first day of the seventh month following the date of the Participant\u2019s Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of the Participant\u2019s death. (f)         Election of Matching Award Type. The type of Matching Award granted to the Participant will be determined based on the Participant\u2019s Distribution Date election under the Purchase Plan. If the Participant elects a Termination Date Election or a Deferred Distribution Date Election (as these terms are defined in the Purchase Plan), the Participant will receive a Matching Award of Deferred Stock Units. If the Participant elects a Vesting Date Election (as defined under the Purchase Plan), the Participant will receive a Matching Award of Restricted Stock Units. (g)         Change in Control. (i)          The Program and Stock Units that are outstanding will continue in the manner and under the terms so provided in the event of any Change in Control (as defined below), with appropriate adjustments as to the number and type of shares underlying the award (disregarding any consideration that is not common stock). (ii)         In connection with a Change in Control (as defined below) and notwithstanding anything in Sections 2(b) or 6(e) to the contrary, the Company may, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), terminate the Program and cause the outstanding Stock Units to be terminated with the effect that shares of Stock subject to such Stock Units will be delivered immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control. 3  \t\t    \t\t \t\t \t\t\tFor purposes of the Program, \u201cChange in Control\u201d will have the same meaning as defined in the 2015 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the Program, in no event will a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred if the transaction is not also a \u201cchange in the ownership or effective control of\u201d the Company or \u201ca change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of\u201d the Company as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) (without regard to any alternative definition thereunder). (h)        Award Agreements. Each award of Stock Units granted under the Program will be evidenced by an Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant memorializing the terms and conditions of the Stock Units.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/walker-dunlop-inc-1418/contract/312606/#clause-id-672212", "variations": []}
