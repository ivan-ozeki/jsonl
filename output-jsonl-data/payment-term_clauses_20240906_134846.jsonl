Payments of principal and interest due under this Note, if not sooner declared to be due in accordance with the provisions hereof, shall be made as follows: (a) Regularly Scheduled Interest and Principal Payments. Commencing on April 1, 2018 and continuing on the first (1st) day of each month thereafter (each, a \"Payment Date\"), to and including the month in which the Maturity Date occurs, Maker shall pay and deliver to Lender: (i) consecutive monthly payments of principal in an amount to fully amortize the principal balance of this Note over a twelve (12) month period; and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal balance of this Note, in arrears. (b) Maturity Date. The unpaid principal balance of this Note, if not sooner paid or declared to be due in accordance with the terms hereof, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts due and payable hereunder, shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. 3.2 Application of Payments. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, all payments and prepayments on account of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall be applied as follows: (a) first, to fees, expenses, costs and other similar amounts then due and payable to Lender, (b) second, to accrued and unpaid interest on the principal balance of this Note, (c) third, to the payment of principal due in the month in which the payment or prepayment is made, (d) fourth, to any escrows, impounds or other amounts which may then be due and payable, (e) fifth, to any other amounts then due Lender hereunder, and (f) last, to the unpaid principal balance of this Note in the inverse order of maturity. Any prepayment on account of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall not extend or postpone the due date or reduce the amount of any subsequent monthly payment of principal and interest due hereunder. After an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, payments may be applied by Lender to amounts owed hereunder in such order as Lender shall determine, in its sole discretion. 3.3 Method of Payments. All payments of principal and interest hereunder shall be paid by automatic debit, wire transfer, check or in coin or currency which, at the time or times of payment, is the legal tender for public and private debts in the United States of America and shall be made at such place as Lender or the legal holder or holders of this Note may from time to time appoint in the payment invoice or otherwise in writing, and in the absence of such appointment, then at the offices of Lender at: Pass Creek Resources 404 Broadway, Suite 508 San Antonio, Texas Attn: Robert Watson Jr. Payment made by check shall be deemed paid on the date Lender receives such check; provided, however, that if such check is subsequently returned to Lender unpaid due to insufficient funds or otherwise, the payment shall not be deemed to have been made and shall continue to bear interest until collected.

Maker agrees that the damages to be sustained by the holder hereof for the detriment caused by any late payment are extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain, and that the amount of five cents for each one dollar due is a reasonable estimate of such damages, does not constitute interest, and is not a penalty.

{"clause_number": "Clause 49", "title": "Payment Terms", "text": "Payment Terms. a. With respect to Pre-2016 Company Contributions, payment will be made in a single lump sum. b. With respect to Post-2015 Company Contributions, this Supplemental DC Plan provides for payment as follows: i. The default original payment method for the Company Contributions for each Plan Year will be a series of annual payments over five (5) consecutive years. Each payment will equal one fifth of the aggregate amount of Company Contributions made on behalf of the Participant for the Plan Year, plus related earnings through the time of payment. For example, if the Company Contributions made on behalf of a Participant for a Plan Year equal $50,000, each of the five (5) annual payments to the Participant will equal $10,000 plus related earnings through the time each payment is made. Each payment in the series to the Participant, because earnings will be credited over different periods of time, may differ in amount. ii. A Participant may elect, to the extent provided in Section VI.3 below with respect to Company Contributions for 2017 and subsequent Plan Years, to receive payment of the Company Contributions for a Plan Year in (I) a single lump sum or in (II) a series of annual payments over a period from two (2) years to fifteen (15) consecutive years in lieu of the default payment method set forth in Section VI.2.b.i above. If a Participant elects a series of annual payments over two (2) to fifteen (15) consecutive years, each payment will equal a fraction of the aggregate amount of Company 5 Contributions made on behalf of the Participant for the Plan Year, the numerator of which is one and denominator of which is the number of years elected by the Participant, plus related earnings through the time of payment. For example, if the Company Contributions made on behalf of a Participant for a Plan Year equal $50,000, and the Participant elects to have such Company Contributions paid over ten (10) consecutive years, each of the ten (10) annual payments to the Participant will equal $5,000 plus related earnings through the time each payment is made. Each payment in the series to the Participant, because earnings will be credited over different periods of time, may differ in amount.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/consumers-energy-co-6496/contract/374296/#clause-id-806092", "variations": []}
