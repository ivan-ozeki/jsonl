Additionally, Executive\u2019s outstanding stock options shall remain outstanding until the original expiration date of the stock options (disregarding any earlier expiration date based on Executive\u2019s termination of employment). Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments to be made and benefits to be provided under this Section are subject to the provisions of Section 5(f) and (h) above. (b) \u201cChange of Control\u201d shall mean the date as of which: (i) there shall be consummated (1) any consolidation or merger of Parent to which the Parent is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which the ordinary shares of Parent would be converted     10         into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of Parent in which the holders of Parent\u2019s ordinary shares immediately prior to the merger own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the continuing or surviving entity, or (2) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of Parent or (ii) the stockholders of Parent approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Parent; or (iii) otherwise (any person) as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of Parent\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares (in a single transaction or within twelve (12) months from the date of the final acquisition) or (iv) during any one year, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the entire Board of Directors of Parent shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Parent\u2019s stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors still then in office who were directors at the beginning of the period. This definition of \u201cChange in Control\u201d is intended to comply with the definition of a change in the ownership or effective control of Parent or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Parent within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and shall be construed consistent with that intent. (c) \u201cGood Reason\u201d shall mean any of the following actions taken by the Company without the Executive\u2019s written consent after a Change of Control:  (i) The assignment to the Executive by the Company or Parent of duties inconsistent with, or the reduction of the powers and functions associated with, the Executive\u2019s position, duties, responsibilities and status with the Company or Parent immediately prior to a Change of Control or Potential Change of Control (as defined below), or an adverse change in Executive\u2019s titles or offices as in effect immediately prior to a Change of Control or Potential Change of Control, or any removal of the Executive from or any failure to re-elect Executive to any of such positions, except in connection with the termination of his employment for Disability or Cause or as a result of Executive\u2019s death except to the extent that a change in duties relates to the elimination of responsibilities attendant to Parent no longer being a publicly traded company;  (ii) A reduction by the Company or Parent in the Executive\u2019s Base Salary as in effect on the date of a Change of Control or Potential Change of Control, or as the same may be increased from time to time during the term of his Agreement;  (iii) The Company or Parent shall require the Executive to be based anywhere other than at Parent\u2019s principal executive offices or the location where the Executive is based on the date of a Change of Control or Potential Change of Control, or if Executive agrees to such relocation, the Company fails to reimburse the Executive for moving and all other expenses reasonably incurred with such move;     11        (iv) The Company or Parent shall fail to continue in effect any Company-sponsored plan or benefit that is in effect on the date of a Change of Control or Potential Change of Control, that provides (A) annual incentive or bonus compensation, (B) fringe benefits such as vacation, medical benefits, life insurance and dental insurance, (C) reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with the performance of duties with the Company, or (D) pension benefits such as a Code Section 401(k) plan and the Company\u2019s nonqualified defined benefit plan, except to the extent that such plans taken as a whole are replaced with substantially comparable plans;  (v) Any material breach by the Company of any provision of this Agreement; or  (vi) Any failure by the Company or Parent to obtain the assumption of this Agreement by any successor or assign of the Company or Parent effected in accordance with the provisions of Section 6. (d) \u201cPotential Change of Control\u201d shall mean the date as of which (1) Parent enters into an agreement the consummation of which, or the approval by shareholders of which, would constitute a Change of Control; (ii) proxies for the election of Directors of Parent are solicited by anyone other than Parent; (iii) any person (including, but not limited to, any individual, partnership, joint venture, corporation, association or trust) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which, if consummated, would constitute a Change of Control; or (iv) any other event occurs which is deemed to be a Potential Change of Control by the Board of Parent and the Board of Directors of Parent adopts a resolution to the effect that a Potential Change of Control has occurred. (e) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a \u201cPayment\u201d) would be subject to the excise tax (the \u201cExcise Tax\u201d) imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then, prior to the making of any such Payment to Executive, the Payment shall be limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. In that event, cash payments shall be modified or reduced first on a pro rata basis, then any other benefits on a pro rata basis and finally any vesting of equity awards on a pro rata basis. The determination of whether an Excise Tax would be imposed, the amount of such Excise Tax, and the calculation of the amounts referred to herein shall be made by an independent accounting firm selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Executive, at the Company\u2019s expense (the \u201cAccounting Firm\u201d), and the Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Payments which Executive was entitled to, but did not receive pursuant to this Section 6(e), could have been made without the imposition of the Excise Tax (\u201cUnderpayment\u201d). 12         In such event, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/arris-international-125/contract/364836/#clause-id-789724", "variations": []}
