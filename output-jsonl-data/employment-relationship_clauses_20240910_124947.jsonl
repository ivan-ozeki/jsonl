If the Employee\u2019s employment with the Company terminates on or at any time within twenty-four (24) months after a Change of Control, then subject to the release requirement described below, the Employee shall be entitled to receive severance benefits as a result of his \u201cseparation from service\u201d (as determined under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h)) as follows:  (i) Involuntary Termination.

(2) the Company shall pay the Employee, on the 30th day following his \u201cseparation from service\u201d, a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the amount of the COBRA premiums that the Employee would incur to continue the Company\u2019s group health, dental, and vision plan coverage for himself and his eligible dependents (as in effect immediately prior to the \u201cseparation from service\u201d) for eighteen (18) months; and  (3) the Company shall accelerate the vesting of all of the Employee\u2019s then-outstanding compensatory equity awards (including but not limited to performance stock awards, stock options, restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock), effective as of the date of his \u201cseparation from service.\u201d  (ii) Voluntary Resignation; Termination For Cause. If the Employee voluntarily resigns from the Company without Good Reason, or if the Company terminates the Employee\u2019s employment for Cause, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those (if any) to which he may be entitled under the Company\u2019s then existing severance and benefits plans and policies at the time of such resignation or termination. (iii) Disability; Death. If the Company terminates the Employee\u2019s employment as a result of the Employee\u2019s Disability, or if the Employee\u2019s employment terminates due to the death of the Employee, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those (if any) to which he may be entitled under the Company\u2019s then existing severance and benefits plans and policies at the time of such Disability or death. (b) Termination Apart from a Change of Control. If the Employee\u2019s employment with the Company terminates either prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control or after the twenty-four (24) month period following a Change of Control, then subject to the release requirement described below, the Employee shall be entitled to receive severance benefits as a result of his \u201cseparation from service\u201d as follows:  (i) Involuntary Termination. If the Employee\u2019s employment terminates as a result of Involuntary Termination (other than for Cause or as a result of death or Disability):  (1) the Company shall pay the Employee, on the 30th day following his \u201cseparation from service\u201d, a lump sum cash severance payment equal to one (1) times the Employee\u2019s Base Compensation for the Company\u2019s fiscal year then in effect (ignoring any reduction that forms the basis for Good Reason) or if greater, one (1) times the Employee\u2019s Base Compensation for the Company\u2019s fiscal year immediately preceding the \u201cseparation from service.\u201d  (2) the Company shall pay the Employee, on the 30th day following his \u201cseparation from service\u201d, a lump sum cash severance payment equal to one (1) times the Employee\u2019s Target Incentive for the fiscal year then in effect (ignoring any reduction that forms the basis for Good Reason) or, if no Target Incentive is in effect for such year, one (1) times the Employee\u2019s highest Target Incentive in the three (3) preceding fiscal years. (3) the Company shall pay the Employee, on the 30th day following his \u201cseparation from service\u201d, a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the amount of the COBRA premiums that the Employee would incur to continue the Company\u2019s group health, dental, and vision plan coverage for himself and his eligible dependents (as in effect immediately prior to the \u201cseparation from service\u201d) for twelve (12) months. 2        (ii) Voluntary Resignation; Termination for Cause. If the Employee voluntarily resigns from the Company (other than a resignation that is an Involuntary Termination), or if the Company terminates the Employee\u2019s employment for Cause, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those, if any, as may then be established under the Company\u2019s then-existing severance and benefits plans and policies at the time of such resignation or termination. (iii) Disability; Death. If the Company terminates the Employee\u2019s employment as a result of the Employee\u2019s Disability, or if the Employee\u2019s employment terminates due to the death of the Employee, then the Employee shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits except for those (if any) as may then be established under the Company\u2019s then-existing severance and benefit plans and policies at the time of such Disability or death. (c) Release. The Employee will not be entitled to receive any severance payments or benefits under this Agreement unless (i) he has delivered to the Company a standard employee waiver and release of claims in favor of the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, and (ii) such release has become effective not later than the 30th day following his \u201cseparation from service.\u201d The Company or any successor thereto must provide a copy of the release to the Employee not more than two (2) days after the Employee\u2019s \u201cseparation from service.\u201d  (d) No Participation In The Synopsys, Inc. Executive Change of Control Severance Benefit Plan. It is agreed that the severance benefits described in this Agreement are in lieu of the severance benefits described in The Synopsys, Inc. Executive Change of Control Severance Benefit Plan, as amended from time to time (the \u201cPlan\u201d), and that Employee is not eligible to participate in the Plan. (e) Application of Section 409A. It is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this Agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(4), 1.409A-1(b)(5) and 1.409A-1(b)(9), and this Agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, to the extent applicable. For purposes of Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 2(b)(2)(iii)), the Employee\u2019s right to receive any payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. If the Employee is deemed by the Company at the time of his \u201cseparation from service\u201d to be a \u201cspecified employee\u201d for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), and if any of the payments upon \u201cseparation from service\u201d set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the Company are deemed to be \u201cdeferred compensation,\u201d then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments shall not be provided to the Employee prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the Employee\u2019s \u201cseparation from service\u201d with the Company, (ii) the date of his or her death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation. Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments delayed pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to the Employee, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. No interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred. (f) Parachute Payments. Except as otherwise provided in an agreement between Employee and the Company, if any payment or benefit the Employee would receive in connection with a change of control from the Company or otherwise (\u201cPayment\u201d) would (i) constitute a \u201cparachute payment\u201d within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the \u201cExcise Tax\u201d), then such Payment shall be equal to the \u201cReduced Amount.\u201d The Reduced Amount shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax, or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in the Employee\u2019s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater amount of the Payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction or elimination in payments or benefits constituting \u201cparachute payments\u201d is necessary so that the Payment equals the Reduced Amount, reduction shall occur in the following order: (1) reduction of cash payments; (2) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards other than stock options; (3) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (4) reduction of other benefits paid to Employee. Within any such category of payments and benefits (that is, (1)-(4)), a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not \u201cdeferred compensation\u201d within the meaning of Section 409A and then with respect to amounts that are \u201cdeferred compensation.\u201d If acceleration of vesting of compensation from Employee\u2019s equity awards is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled by first canceling such acceleration for the vesting installment that will vest last and continuing by canceling as a first priority such acceleration for vesting installment with the latest vesting. 3        7. Definition of Terms. The following terms referred to in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:  (a) Cause. \u201cCause\u201d shall mean (i) any act of personal dishonesty taken by the Employee in connection with his responsibilities as an employee and intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of the Employee, (ii) conviction of a felony that is injurious to the Company, (iii) a willful act by the Employee which constitutes gross misconduct and which is injurious to the Company, or (iv) continued violations by the Employee of the Employee\u2019s obligations under Section 1 of this Agreement that are demonstrably willful and deliberate on the Employee\u2019s part after there has been delivered to the Employee a written demand for performance from the Company which describes the basis for the Company\u2019s belief that the Employee has not substantially performed his duties.

(c) Disability. \u201cDisability\u201d shall mean that the Employee has been unable to substantially perform his duties under this Agreement as the result of his incapacity due to physical or mental illness, and such inability, at least 26 weeks after its commencement, is determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Employee or the Employee\u2019s legal representative (such Agreement as to acceptability not to be unreasonably withheld).

(f) Involuntary Termination. \u201cInvoluntary Termination\u201d shall mean (i) any termination of employment of the Employee by the Company which is not effected for Disability or for Cause; or (ii) the Employee\u2019s resignation for Good Reason, provided that the Employee\u2019s resignation for Good Reason is effective not later than two (2) years from the initial occurrence of such Good Reason, the Employee has provided notice to the Company of the event constituting Good Reason within ninety (90) days of its initial occurrence and the Company has had at least thirty (30) days to cure the Good Reason event and has failed to do so. 4        8.
