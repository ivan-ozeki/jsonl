All Services provided to the Company under this Agreement shall be performed by each of Mark, Matthew and Kim personally, unless the Company gives written permission to the Consultant for someone other than the Moores to perform the Services. The Consultant and the Moores, in rendering Services, agree to comply with all sales and marketing policies of the Company and its Affiliates, to the extent applicable to the Services, as such policies may be amended from time to time. The term \u201cBusiness\u201d as used in this Agreement, means the service of dispensing and fitting hearing aids and operating hearing aid dispensing centers. Services hereunder shall in no event include providing any medical advice to patients or other end-users of hearing aids or other products of the Company. (b) Supervision. The Moores possess unique skills and knowledge, and the Company is retaining Consultant to obtain and receive these unique skills and knowledge in the performance of Services. Accordingly, the Company shall not directly supervise the Moores as they provide the Services; provided, however, that Consultant\u2019s work for the Company shall conform to this Section 2. (c) Reporting; Best Efforts. During the Consulting Period, Consultant will report to the President of the Company, or to such other Company executives as may be designated by the Company. The Moores, while rendering Services on behalf of Consultant, will devote their best efforts to the business and affairs of the Company. The Moores, through the Consultant, will render all Services to the best of their ability in a diligent, timely, trustworthy, businesslike and efficient manner. (d) Hours of Work. Other than scheduled appointments, meetings, telephone conferences and other scheduled events, the Consultant may determine its own hours of work in performing Services, and the Consultant may perform Services out of the Moores\u2019 own homes, rather than working out of the Company\u2019s offices. (e) Private Pay. To the extent possible, Consultant shall limit marketing efforts to patients who are not enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan or other federally funded healthcare program. (f) Additional Services. The Company may reasonably expand or limit the Services under this Agreement; provided, however, that any expansion of services shall be consistent with the Services, as defined in this Agreement.
