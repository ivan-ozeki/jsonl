Certain Reduction of Payments by the Company. (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a \"Payment\"), would be nondeductible by the Company for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Code, then the aggregate present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement (such payments or distributions pursuant to this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as \"Agreement Payments\") shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. The \"Reduced Amount\" shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to be nondeductible by the Company because of Section 280G of the Code. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Reduced Amount is zero and it is determined further that any Payment which is not an Agreement Payment would nevertheless be nondeductible by the Company for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Code, then the aggregate present value of Payments which are not Agreement Payments shall also be reduced (but not below zero) to an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Payments without causing any Payment to be nondeductible by the Company because of Section 280G of the Code. For purposes of this Section 16, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. Any amount which is not paid in the taxable year in which it was originally scheduled to be paid as a result of the postponement thereof pursuant hereto shall be payable in the next succeeding taxable year in which such payment will not result in the disallowance of a deduction pursuant to either Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code; provided, however, that all postponed payments shall be placed in a Rabbi trust or similar vehicle for the benefit of the Executive in such a way that the amounts so transferred are not taxable to such person or deductible by the Company until payment from such vehicle to the Executive is made. In the event a payment has been made to the Executive, but then disallowed as a deduction by the Internal Revenue Service and return of the payment is required into the trust, said payment to the Executive shall be treated as a loan and said payment to the trust shall be treated as repayment of said loan. The Company shall not pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber any amounts held in the trust or other similar vehicle for the benefit of the Executive hereunder. (b) All determinations required to be made under this Section 16 shall be made by the L J Sullivan, CPA, LLC or, at the Executive's option, any other nationally or regionally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the Executive and approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the \"Accounting Firm\"), which shall provide (i) detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within twenty (20) business days of the termination of Executive\u2019s employment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company, and (ii) an opinion to the Executive that he has substantial authority not to report any excise tax on his Federal income tax return with respect to any Payments. Any such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. The Executive shall determine which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of this Section 16, provided that, if the Executive does not make such determination within ten business days of the receipt of the calculations made by the Accounting Firm, the Company shall elect which and how much of the Payments shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of this Section 16 and shall notify the Executive promptly of such election. Within five business days thereafter, the Company shall pay to or distribute to or for the benefit of the Executive such amounts as are then due to the Executive under this Agreement. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in connection with the determinations contemplated by this Section 16 shall be borne by the Company. (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Payments will have been made by the Company which should not have been made (\"Overpayment\") or that additional Payments which will not have been made by the Company could have been made (\"Underpayment\"), in each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Employee to the Company if and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/gb-sciences-inc-2350/contract/402474/#clause-id-860037", "variations": []}

(b) Within forty (40) days following the Executive\u2019s Termination of Employment or notice by one party to the other of its belief that there is a payment or benefit due the Executive that will result in an excess parachute payment, the Executive and the Company, at the Company\u2019s expense, shall obtain the opinion (which need not be unqualified) of nationally recognized tax counsel (\u201cNational Tax Counsel\u201d) selected by the Company\u2019s independent auditors and reasonably acceptable to the Executive (which may be regular outside counsel to the Company), which opinion sets forth (i) the amount of the Base Period Income (as defined below), (ii) the amount and present value of the Total Payments, (iii) the amount and present value of any excess parachute payments determined without regard to any reduction of Total Payments pursuant to Section 8(a), and (iv) the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive, taking into account the tax imposed under Code Section 4999 if (x) the Total Payments were reduced in accordance with Section 8(a)(ii), or (y) the Total Payments were not so reduced. The opinion of National Tax Counsel shall be addressed to the Company and the Executive and shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. If such National Tax Counsel opinion determines that clause (ii) of Section 8(a) applies, then the Payments hereunder or any other payment or benefit determined by such counsel to be includable in Total Payments shall be reduced or eliminated so that under the bases of calculations set forth in such opinion there will be no excess parachute payment. In such event, payments or benefits included in the Total Payments shall be reduced or eliminated by applying the following principles, in order: (1) the payment or benefit with the higher ratio of the parachute payment value to present economic value (determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions) shall be reduced or eliminated before a payment or benefit with a lower ratio; (2) the payment or benefit with the later possible payment date shall be reduced or eliminated before a payment or benefit with an earlier payment date; and (3) cash payments shall be reduced prior to non-cash benefits; provided that if the foregoing order of reduction or elimination would violate Code Section 409A, then the reduction shall be made pro rata among the payments or benefits included in the Payments (on the basis of the relative present value of the parachute payments). (c) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the terms \u201cexcess parachute payment\u201d and \u201cparachute payments\u201d shall have the meanings assigned to them in Code Section 280G and such \u201cparachute payments\u201d shall be valued as provided therein. Present value for purposes of this Agreement shall be calculated in accordance with Code Section 280G(d)(4); (ii) the term \u201cBase Period Income\u201d means an amount equal to the Executive\u2019s \u201cannualized includible compensation for the base period\u201d as defined in Code Section 280G(d)(1); (iii) for purposes of the opinion of National Tax Counsel, the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall     16         be determined by the Company\u2019s independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Code Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4), which determination shall be evidenced in a certificate of such auditors addressed to the Company and the Executive; and (iv) the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax and employment taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income and employment taxation, and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state or locality of the Executive\u2019s domicile (determined in both cases in the calendar year in which the Covered Termination or notice described in Section 8(b) is given, whichever is earlier), net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes that may be obtained from the deduction of such state and local taxes. (d) If such National Tax Counsel so requests in connection with the opinion required by this Section 8, the Executive and the Company shall obtain, at the Company\u2019s expense, and the National Tax Counsel may rely on, the advice of a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants as to the reasonableness of any item of compensation to be received by the Executive solely with respect to its status under Code Section 280G. (e) The Company agrees to bear all costs associated with, and to indemnify and hold harmless, the National Tax Counsel of and from any and all claims, damages, and expenses resulting from or relating to its determinations pursuant to this Section 8, except for claims, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such firm. (f) This Section 8 shall be amended to comply with any amendment or successor provision to Sections 280G or 4999 of the Code. If such provisions are repealed without successor, then this Section 8 shall be cancelled without further effect. (g) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8 shall apply to the Total Payments pursuant to the Merger and any subsequent Change of Control, respectively.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/johnson-controls-international-738/contract/385088/#clause-id-820919", "variations": []}

{"clause_number": "Clause 13", "title": "Full Settlement", "text": "Full Settlement. In no event shall Employee be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to Employee under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not Employee obtains other employment. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which Employee may reasonably incur as a result of any contest or dispute by the Company or Employee with respect to liability under, or the interpretation of the validity or enforceability of, any provision of this Agreement, but only in the event and to the extent that (i) Employee receives a final, non-appealable judgment in his favor in any such action or receives a final judgment in his favor that has not been appealed by the Company within 30 days of the date of the judgment; or (ii) the Parties agree to dismiss any such action upon the Company\u2019s payment of the sums allegedly due Employee or performance of the covenants by the Company allegedly breached by it. 11      9. PROTECTIVE COVENANTS   (a)          Confidential Information. Employee and the Company are Parties to one or more separate agreements respecting confidential information, trade secrets, and inventions, including, without limitation, the Employee Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement signed in connection with and as a condition of Employee\u2019s employment with the Company (collectively, the \u201cIP Agreements\u201d); provided, that any agreements respecting confidential information, trade secrets, and inventions shall be consistent with, and no more burdensome than, the Employee\u2019s obligations under the Employee Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement signed in connection with and as a condition of Employee\u2019s employment with the Company, unless such changes result from changes to applicable law. The Parties agree that the IP Agreements shall not be superseded or terminated by this Agreement and shall survive for three years post termination of this Agreement. (b)          Non-Compete Commitment. During the Employment Period and for a period of one year following the Date of Termination, regardless of the reason for the termination of Employee\u2019s employment and whether such termination occurs at the initiative of Employee or the Company, Employee agrees that he will not accept any position as principal executive officer, president, or Chief Medical Officer with, or provide comparable level executive consultation to any Competitive Business of the Company. As used herein, a \u201cCompetitive Business\u201d is a business (including, but not limited to, a business started by Employee) that is in the business of providing activities, products, or services that are competitive with those provided by the Company and that are of the type conducted, authorized, offered, provided, or under development by the Company, including without limitation any business or activity related to the development of pharmaceuticals or treatments for the suppression of the HSV-1 virus and related viruses, within one year prior to Employee\u2019s Date of Termination. (c)          Agreement Not to Solicit Employees. During the Employment Period and for a period of one year following the Date of Termination, regardless of the reason for the termination of Employee\u2019s employment and whether such termination occurs at the initiative of Employee or the Company, Employee covenants and agrees that Employee shall not (a) solicit, recruit, or hire (or attempt to solicit, recruit, or hire) or otherwise assist anyone in soliciting, recruiting, or hiring, any employee of the Company who performed work for the Company within the last year of Employee\u2019s employment with the Company until that employee\u2019s employment with the Company has been voluntarily or involuntarily terminated for at least six months, or (b) otherwise encourage, solicit, or support any employee(s) to leave their employment with the Company. (d)          Non-Solicitation of Customers or Clients. During the Employment Period and for a period of one year following the Date of Termination, regardless of the reason for the termination of Employee\u2019s employment and whether such termination occurs at the initiative of Employee or the Company, Employee agrees not to solicit, directly or by assisting others, any business from any of the Company\u2019s customers or clients, including actively sought prospective customers or clients, with whom Employee has had material contact during the one-year period prior to the termination of the Employment Period with the Company, for the purpose of providing products or services that are competitive with those provided by the Company. As used in this paragraph, \u201cmaterial contact\u201d means the contact between Employee and each customer, client or vendor, or potential customer, client or vendor (i) with whom or which Employee dealt on behalf of the employer, (ii) whose dealings with the Company were coordinated or supervised by Employee, (iii) about whom Employee obtained confidential information in the ordinary course of business as a result of Employee\u2019s association with the Company, or (iv) who receives products or services authorized by the Company, the sale or provision of which results or resulted in compensation, commissions, or earnings (directly or indirectly) for Employee within one year prior to Employee\u2019s Date of Termination. 12      (e)          Non-Disparagement. Employee agrees not to make disparaging remarks, or remarks that could reasonably be construed as disparaging, regarding the Company, its subsidiaries, their directors, officers, or employees, businesses or practices during the Employment Period and thereafter. Company, on behalf of its officers, directors and managers, agrees not to make disparaging remarks, or remarks that could reasonably be construed as disparaging, regarding Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, this non-disparagement obligation shall not in any way affect either party\u2019s obligation to testify truthfully in any legal proceeding. (f)           Certain Payment Obligations/Consideration. Employee agrees that the payment of any Severance Payment, Benefits Continuation Payments or Change of Control Termination Payment shall be subject to and expressly conditioned upon Employee\u2019s compliance with the covenants set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this Section 10 (collectively, the \u201cProtective Covenants\u201d). Payments of amounts owing under any Change of Control Termination Payment, Severance Payment or Benefits Continuation Payments obligation shall be conditioned upon Employee\u2019s continued compliance with the Protective Covenants. Should Employee fail to comply with any of the Protective Covenants, the Company shall not be required to make the Change of Control Termination Payment, Severance Payment (or any portion thereof remaining unpaid), or Benefits Continuation Payments and Employee shall be required to repay any portion of the Change of Control Termination Payment, Severance Payment, or Benefits Continuation Payments that Employee has already received from the Company. Employee acknowledges that the consideration for the Protective Covenants includes the employment granted and the salary and other compensation provided hereunder including, but not limited to, the covenants respecting a Severance Payment, Change of Control Termination Payment, or Benefits Continuation Payments. (g)          Specific Performance. Employee acknowledges that it would be difficult to calculate the Company\u2019s damages from Employee\u2019s breach of any of the Protective Covenants and that money damages (even including any repayments made pursuant to paragraph (f)) would therefore be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, upon such breach, Employee acknowledges that the Company may seek and shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary, and/or permanent injunctive relief against Employee, and/or other appropriate orders to restrain such breach. Nothing in this provision shall limit or prevent the Company from seeking any other damages or relief provided by applicable law for breach of this Agreement or any section or provision hereof. Employee agrees that the Company may obtain specific performance, and that the Company shall not be required to post bond in the event it is necessary for the Company to obtain temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any bond requirement hereby being expressly waived by Employee. (h)          Protective Covenant Enforceability. The Parties covenant and agree that the provisions contained in paragraphs (a) through (g) are reasonable and are not known or believed to be in violation of any federal, state, or local law, rule, or regulation. It is the reasonable intent and expectation of the Parties that these protective covenants shall be enforced in accordance with their terms. However, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision herein (or subpart thereof) to be void or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court shall modify the provision(s) (or subpart(s) thereof) to make the provision(s) (or subpart(s) thereof) and this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Any illegal or unenforceable provision (or subpart thereof), or any modification by any court, shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, which shall continue at all times to be valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms. 13      10. SUCCESSORS. (a)          Successors in Interest. This Agreement is personal to Employee and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by Employee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Employee\u2019s legal representatives. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. (b)          Assumption of Agreement. The Company will require any successor who acquires all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, the \u201cCompany\u201d shall mean Virios Therapeutics, Inc., as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/virios-therapeutics-llc-11092/contract/129065/#clause-id-29676", "variations": []}

The terms of this Section 9(a) shall not prevent the Company from pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Executive. The Executive and the Company further agree that the provisions of the covenants contained in this Section 9 and the Invention and Non-Disclosure Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A, and the Non-Compete Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B are, in each case, reasonable and necessary to protect the businesses of the Company and its affiliated companies because of the Executive\u2019s access to confidential information and the Executive\u2019s material participation in the operation of such businesses.

Confidential Information; Restrictive Covenants. (a) The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive\u2019s employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Executive\u2019s employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. The Executive agrees that any breach of the terms of this Section 7 or the Noncompete Agreement would result in irreparable injury and damage to the Company for which the Company would have no adequate remedy at law. The Executive therefore also agrees that in the event of said breach or any threat of breach, the Company shall be entitled to an immediate injunction and restraining order to prevent such breach and/or threatened breach and/or continued breach by the Executive and/or any and all Persons acting for and/or with the Executive, without having to prove damages, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the obligation of the Executive to return any portion of the severance payments and benefits set forth in Section 3(a)(ii) paid by the Company to the Executive. The terms of this Section 7(a) shall not prevent the Company from pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Executive. The Executive and the Company further agree that the provisions of the covenants contained in this Section 7 and the Noncompete Agreement, in each case, reasonable and necessary to protect the businesses of the Company and its affiliated companies because of the Executive\u2019s access to confidential information and the Executive\u2019s material participation in the operation of such businesses. (b) From and after the Effective Date, including at all times following the Date of Termination, (i) the Executive agrees not to make any statement that is intended to become public, or that should reasonably be expected to become public, and that criticizes, ridicules, disparages or is otherwise derogatory of the Company, any of its affiliated companies, or their respective employees, officers, directors or stockholders, and (ii) the Company shall direct its officers, directors, and other authorized representatives not to make any statement that is intended to become public, or that should reasonably be expected to become public, and that criticizes, ridicules, disparages or is otherwise derogatory of the Executive. No provision of this Agreement or the Noncompete Agreement shall be interpreted so as to impede the Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making any other disclosures under the whistleblower provisions of United States federal law or regulation. The Executive does not need the Company\u2019s prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures, and the Executive shall not be required to notify the Company that such reports or disclosures have been made. In addition, no provision of this Agreement or the Noncompete Agreement precludes the Executive from providing truthful testimony when lawfully subpoenaed or otherwise required to do so by law.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/immucell-corp-7238/contract/100438/#clause-id-189852", "variations": []}
