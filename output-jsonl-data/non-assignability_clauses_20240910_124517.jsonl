[(a)]In the event Employee's Continuous Employment [terminates] [is terminated] prior to the relevant Distribution Date [by reason] [on account] of death [or Disability (as defined inSection 2.19 of the Plan)], and if Employee had otherwise met the requirements of Continuous Employment, Non-competition and No Improper Conduct from the Grant Date through the date of such death [or Disability], then Employee shall upon death [or Disability (as the case may be)] be deemed to have fully satisfied all of the conditions of transfer in paragraph 6 and Employee's rights hereunder with respect to any such MI Shares shall inure to the benefit of [Employee (or, in the case of death] Employee's executors, administrators, personal representatives and assigns[)]. [(b)In the event Employee's Continuous Employment terminates prior to the relevant Distribution Date by reason of Employee's Retirement (as defined below), and if Employee had otherwise met the requirements of Continuous Employment, Non-competition and No Improper Conduct from the Grant Date through the date of such Retirement, and provided that Employee continues to meet the requirements of Non-competition and No Improper Conduct, then Employee's rights hereunder with respect to any outstanding MI Shares shall continue in the same manner as if Employee continued to meet the Continuous Employment requirement through the Distribution Dates related to the Award, except not for that portion of MI Shares granted less than one year prior to Employee's termination equal to such number of shares multiplied by the ratio of (a) the number of days after the termination date and before the first anniversary of the Grant Date, over (b) the number of days in the twelve (12) month period following the Grant Date. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Retirement\" shall mean termination of employment [on account of Disability (as defined in Section 2.19 of the Plan) or] by retiring with the specific approval of the Committee on or after such date on which Employee has attained age 55 and completed ten (10) Years of Service.] Except as set forth in this paragraph 8 above, no other transfer of rights with respect to MI Shares shall be permitted pursuant to this Agreement. 8A. Non-Solicitation. In consideration of good and valuable consideration in the form of the MI Share Awards granted herein to which Employee is not otherwise entitled, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in recognition of the Company's legitimate purpose of avoiding for limited times competition from persons whom Marriott has trained and/or given experience, Employee agrees that during the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending one year following his termination of employment with the Company, whether such termination of employment is voluntary or involuntary or with or without cause, he will not, on his own behalf or as a partner, officer, director, employee, agent, or consultant of any other person or entity, directly or indirectly contact, solicit or induce (or attempt to solicit or induce) any employee of the Company to leave their employment with the Company or consider employment with any other person or entity. Employee and the Company agree that any breach by Employee of the non-solicitation obligation under this paragraph will cause the Company immediate, material and irreparable injury and damage, and there is no adequate remedy at law for such breach. Accordingly, in the event of such breach, in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled immediately to seek enforcement of this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction by means of a decree of specific performance, an injunction without the posting of a bond or the requirement of any other guarantee, any other form of equitable relief, liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Fair Market Value of the Awards granted hereunder as of the Grant Date, and the Company is entitled to recover from Employee the costs and attorneys' fees it incurs to recover under or enforce this Agreement. This provision is not a waiver of any other rights that the Company may have under this Agreement, including the right to receive money damages.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/marriott-intl-844/contract/308136/#clause-id-660698", "variations": []}
