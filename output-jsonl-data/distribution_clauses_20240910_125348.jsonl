If a participant incurs an unforeseeable emergency, the participant may make a written request to the Plan Administrator for a hardship withdrawal from the participant\u2019s Account. An unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship to the participant resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the participant or a dependent (as defined in section 152(a) of the Code) of the participant, loss of the participant\u2019s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the participant and which cannot be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the participant\u2019s assets, to the extent that the liquidation of such assets would itself cause severe financial hardship. Withdrawals of amounts because of an unforeseeable emergency are only permitted to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need. The existence of severe financial hardship shall be determined consistent with sections 1.457-2(h)(4) and (5) of the Treasury Regulations.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/honeywell-intl-inc-656/contract/305860/#clause-id-654923", "variations": []}

At the time that a Participant makes an Election to defer Compensation, he or she shall select a method for the distribution of the balance of that Deferred Compensation and any Company Credits credited during such Plan Year, including earnings on such amounts, and such election may include a different form of payment based on whether the Participant\u2019s Termination constitutes Retirement. Upon Termination, the balance of the Participant\u2019s Account shall be distributed to the Participant accordingto the pay-out method or methods selected by the Participant in his or her Elections, payable beginning with the January 31 following the date on which Termination occurs. A Participant may elect to receive his account distribution as a lump sum or in substantially equal annual installments over a set period up to 20 years. Notwithstanding a Participant\u2019s election, payment of benefits shall not be made or commence under the Plan prior to the date which is six months after the date of a Participant\u2019s Termination in the case of a Participant who is determined to be a Specified Employee at the time of his or her   6         Termination. In such case, the Specified Employee\u2019s Account shall be credited with earnings or losses during such six-month period in accordance with Section 6 and distribution shall be made or commence on the day after the last day of such six-month period. (b)           In-Service Account. At the time a Participant makes an Election under the Plan, he or she may elect for the distribution of amounts subject to such Election, and earnings thereon, to be made in a specified year by electing to have such amounts credited to an In-Service Account. Distributions from an In-Service Account shall be paid in a single lump sum on the January 31 of the specified year (or as soon as practicable thereafter during the same calendar year). At the time of the Participant\u2019s Election, he or she may designate whether amounts in his or her In-Service Account shall be paid upon Termination in a single lump sum on the January 31 following the date on which Termination occurs or whether such amounts shall be paid in the specified year. An Election to receive such amounts in a single lump sum upon Termination shall be subject to the six-month delay described in Section 9(a) for a Participant who is a Specified Employee at the time of his or her Termination. A Participant may make different Elections with respect to the applicable distribution periods for different deferral cycles in the In-Service Accounts. (c)           Change of Distribution of Compensation Account. A Participant will be allowed to change the Election as to the distribution of his or her Retirement Account or In-Service Account in accordance with rules established by the Committee by making a subsequent Election. If a Participant makes a subsequent Election, then (a) such election shall not take effect until 12 months after the date on which such election is made, and submitted to the Committee; (b) the first payment with respect to which such election is made shall be deferred for a period of 5 years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made; (c) any election related to a payment that was otherwise to be made at a specified time may not be made less than 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment; and (d) with respect to a change in payment form, such change may not impermissibly accelerate the time or schedule of any payment under the Plan, except as provided in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Treasury. For purposes of applying the provisions of this Section 9(c) to a Participant\u2019s Retirement Account, installment payments shall be considered a single payment for purposes of applying these subsequent election rules. For purposes of applying the provisions of this Section 9(c) to a Participant\u2019s In-Service Account, installment payments shall be considered separate payments for purposes of applying these subsequent election rules. A Participant may elect to have such amounts paid in a single lump sum no later than 30 days after the month in which the Participant\u2019s death occurs, in which case neither the Participant nor a Beneficiary shall have a right to designate the taxable year of the payment. Any election to have such amounts paid in a lump sum, or to change an election to have benefits on the Participant\u2019s death follow his or her original election, shall not be effective until the date which is 12 months after the date on which the election is made. A Participant may designate one or more persons (including a trust) to whom or to which payments are to be made if the Participant dies before receiving distribution of all amounts due under the Plan. A Participant may, at any time, elect to change the designation of a Beneficiary. A   7         designation of Beneficiary will be effective only after the signed designation of Beneficiary is filed with the Committee or its designee while the Participant is alive and will cancel all designations of Beneficiary signed and filed earlier. If the Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above or if all of a Participant\u2019s Beneficiaries predecease him or her and he or she fails to designate a new Beneficiary, the remaining unpaid amounts shall be paid to the estate of such Participant. No person shall have any interest in any such assets by virtue of the provisions of this Plan. The Company\u2019s obligation hereunder shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the provisions hereof, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company; no such person shall have nor acquire any legal or equitable right, interest or claim in or to any property or assets of the Company. Any accounts maintained under this Plan shall be hypothetical in nature and shall be maintained for bookkeeping purposes only. Neither the Plan nor any account shall hold any actual funds or assets. A Participant or Beneficiary cannot waive the provisions of this Section 12. A termination of the Plan must comply with the restrictions or requirements applicable under Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

The Committee or the Company may determine that a severe financial hardship exists only if the distribution is necessary in light of   4         immediate and heavy financial needs of the Participant which cannot be met from the other financial sources available to the Participant and if disallowance of the accelerated distribution would result in a severe financial hardship to the Participant. Amounts which are distributed under this provision will reduce the Participant\u2019s benefit.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/arch-coal-inc-1696/contract/394527/#clause-id-839616", "variations": []}

{"clause_number": "Clause 23", "title": "Distributions", "text": "Distributions. (a) Unvested Incentive Interests. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if at any time the Partnership makes any distribution (other than Tax Advances (as such term is defined in the Partnership Agreement)) or any other payment is made by any Person with respect to any Unvested Incentive Interests that, but for the provisions of this     5         Section 6, the holder of such Unvested Incentive Interests (an \u201cUnvested Holder\u201d) would be entitled to receive, then such distribution or payment shall be made into an escrow account or in a segregated bank account established by the Partnership or otherwise held in reserve by the Partnership (the \u201cEscrow Account\u201d) rather than to such Unvested Holder. The Escrow Account shall provide (i) that the property distributed or paid into such Escrow Account, as adjusted to reflect all earnings and fees thereon (the \u201cEscrow Property\u201d), shall be held for the benefit of such Unvested Holder and for the benefit of the Partnership\u2019s other holders of applicable equity securities as of the time of such distribution or payment, (ii) that any such Escrow Property that is cash may be invested in the discretion of the Partnership (or such other representative of the holders of the Partnership\u2019s applicable equity securities as of the time of such distribution or payment as may be appropriate) in short-term fixed income investments or in a money market account, (iii) that so long as there continues to be Unvested Incentive Interests, such Unvested Holder\u2019s interest in the Escrow Property shall continue to vest in the same manner as the vesting of such Unvested Holder\u2019s Incentive Interests pursuant to the terms hereof and, subject to any applicable transfer restrictions on the Escrow Property, upon the vesting of any Escrow Property, ownership and control of such vested Escrow Property shall be transferred to such Unvested Holder no later than ten (10) Business Days (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) after the vesting of such Escrow Property, (iv) that if such Unvested Holder\u2019s Incentive Interests are forfeited to the Partnership pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement prior to the full vesting of the Escrow Property, then, subject to any applicable transfer restrictions on the Escrow Property, all unvested Escrow Property shall be appropriately distributed to the other holders of the Partnership\u2019s applicable equity securities as of the time of such distribution or payment, and all of the vested Escrow Property that has not previously been distributed to such Unvested Holder shall be distributed to such Unvested Holder, (v) that any JJill Company (or such other representative of the holders of the Partnership\u2019s equity securities as of the time of such distribution or payment as may be appropriate) may be the escrow agent, and (vi) such other terms as the Board (or such other representative of the holders of the Partnership\u2019s equity securities as of the time of such distribution or payment as may be appropriate) may deem appropriate and that are, in all material respects, consistent with the intent of this Agreement (including Sections 4 and 5 and this Section 6). For avoidance of doubt, in the event of an Approved Partnership Sale in which the vesting of the Incentive Interests is not accelerated, distributions in connection with such Approved Partnership Sale shall be made into the Escrow Accounts as provided herein and shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Section 6(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in Section 7.3 of the Partnership Agreement to the contrary, all unvested Escrow Property shall be treated as not having been distributed to the Unvested Holder for purposes of determining whether the Unvested Holder is entitled to a Tax Advance on Unvested Incentive Interests as of any quarterly distribution date pursuant to Section 7.3 of the Partnership Agreement, and any such Tax Advance owing to the Unvested Holder in respect of Unvested Incentive Interests shall be made to the Unvested Holder in the form of either (i) a distribution from the Partnership pursuant to Section 7.3 of the Partnership Agreement or (ii) a distribution from the Escrow Account, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion. (b) Vested Incentive Interests. Distributions from the Partnership with respect to Vested Incentive Interests will be made in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement. 6        7. Right to Purchase Incentive Interests after the Termination Date. (a) Purchase Right. Upon the occurrence of the Termination Date that occurs prior to the consummation of an Approved Partnership Sale, up to all of the Vested Incentive Interests (whether owned by Grantee, any of Grantee\u2019s Affiliates or any other Person) as of the Termination Date (the \u201cPurchasable Incentive Interests\u201d) shall, at the Partnership\u2019s election, be subject to purchase by the Partnership pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 7 (the \u201cPurchase Option\u201d) at a price per Purchasable Incentive Interest equal to the Fair Market Value per Purchasable Incentive Interest determined as of the Termination Date, less the amount of any cash distributed by the Partnership with respect to such Purchasable Incentive Interest between the Termination Date and the closing of the applicable purchase pursuant to the Purchase Option. For the sake of clarity, if the Termination Date occurs following the consummation of an Approved Partnership Sale, the Partnership shall have no Purchase Option. (b) Procedure to Exercise the Purchase Right. The Purchase Option is exercisable by the Partnership (in its sole discretion) by delivering written notice (the \u201cPurchase Notice\u201d) to the holder or holders of the applicable Purchasable Incentive Interests to be purchased at any time during the 210-day period beginning on the Termination Date. The Purchase Notice shall set forth the number of Purchasable Incentive Interests to be acquired from such holder(s), the aggregate consideration to be paid for such holder\u2019s Purchasable Incentive Interests, which shall be the Fair Market Value determined by the Board, and the time and place for the closing of the transaction. The Partnership (with the approval of the Board) may at any time elect, in its sole discretion, to designate any one or more Person(s) to actually purchase (in addition to, or in lieu of, the Partnership) any or all of the Purchasable Incentive Interests for which the Partnership has a Purchase Option hereunder (any such other Person, a \u201cSubstitute Purchaser\u201d). (c) Closing of Purchase. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Section 7 shall take place on the date designated by the Partnership in the Purchase Notice, which date shall not be more than sixty (60) days after the delivery of such notice. The amount of the purchase price to be paid for any Purchasable Incentive Interests to be purchased by the Partnership (and any applicable Substitute Purchasers) pursuant to a Purchase Option shall be determined pursuant to Section 7(a) hereof, and the aggregate amount of such purchase price shall be referred to herein as the \u201cAggregate Purchase Price\u201d. The Partnership (and any applicable Substitute Purchasers) shall pay the applicable Aggregate Purchase Price for any Purchasable Incentive Interests to be purchased by the Partnership and any applicable Substitute Purchaser pursuant to a Purchase Option by delivery of a check payable to or by wire transfer to an account or account(s) designated by the holder(s) of such Purchasable Incentive Interests in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable Aggregate Purchase Price for such Purchasable Incentive Interests. The Partnership and any applicable Substitute Purchaser shall receive from each seller regarding the sale of Purchasable Incentive Interests the representation that such seller has good and marketable title to such Purchasable Incentive Interests and that such Purchasable Incentive Interests shall be transferred to the Partnership and any applicable Substitute Purchaser, as the case may be, free and clear of all liens, claims and other encumbrances and any other representation reasonably requested by Partnership or the Substitute Purchaser. 7        8. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or the effectiveness or validity of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/jjill-inc-5680/contract/330263/#clause-id-714062", "variations": []}

{"clause_number": "Clause 28", "title": "Distributions", "text": "Distributions. Except in the case of Specified Employees, distribution of a Participant\u2019s Account will be made within 90 days after Separation from Service, Disability or death and in accordance with the distribution schedule elected by the Participant. Distribution of a Specified Employee\u2019s Account will be made six months after Separation from Service (other than by Disability or death) in order to conform to Section 409A, then in accordance with the distribution schedule elected by the Participant. Distribution of a Participant\u2019s Account will be based on the number of shares or units and market value of the investments held in the Account upon Separation of Service. A Participant\u2019s Diversified Investment Account will be settled in cash, and the Company Stock Account will be settled in shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Prior to distribution, the Stock Units held in the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account will be converted to whole shares of Common Stock, with any fractional share rounded to the nearest whole share. If Stock Units are credited to the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account after a distribution has been made (e.g., as a result of Dividend Contributions or Additional Matching Contributions), a subsequent distribution of those Stock Units will be made within 60 days of the date the Stock Units are credited to the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account, which distribution in the case of the Additional Matching Contribution will occur in the Calendar Year following the Calendar Year of Separation from Service. 6           Although the Company intends to settle Participants\u2019 Accounts in shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, notwithstanding any other provision of the Program, the Company reserves the right to pay Stock Units in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock, except for distributions to Section 16 Officers. If settled in cash, the amount of the distribution will be equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued. Fair Market Value shall be determined at the date the shares would otherwise have been issued. 5.2 Form of Distribution. Participants may elect to receive distributions of their Accounts in (a) a lump sum amount, or (b) annual installments for up to 15 years. Annual installment distributions will be made by January 31st of each Calendar Year following the Calendar Year of the initial distribution. Each annual distribution will be equal to the balance of the Account divided by the number of payments remaining. If a Participant does not elect a form of distribution in the initial Election or if a Participant\u2019s Account value does not exceed $50,000 upon Separation from Service, the distribution will be made in a lump sum. 5.3 Withholding from Distributions. The Company will withhold from distributions any amount required to pay applicable taxes (at the Company\u2019s required withholding rate). The tax withholding for distributions from the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account will be made in shares of Common Stock. Alternatively, the Participant may pay such taxes in cash if he makes suitable arrangements with the Company before the distribution date. The Committee may, at any time, require a Participant to settle the tax liability in cash. 5.4 Forfeiture of Stock Units. Notwithstanding the above, if a Participant who has less than 5 Years of Service has a Separation from Service, the Participant will forfeit any Stock Units acquired by Company Matching Contributions, Additional Matching Contributions or Dividend Contributions (unless the Committee determines otherwise). However, such Stock Units will not be forfeited if the Participant has a Separation from Service due to death, Disability or Retirement. 5.5 Beneficiary. If a Participant dies before receiving all distributions due under the Program, the remaining distributions will be made to the Participant\u2019s Beneficiary. Each Participant may designate a Beneficiary and change the Beneficiary from time to time. Beneficiary designations are made and tracked through the company\u2019s record keeper. If a Participant has no living designated Beneficiary, then the Beneficiary will be the Participant\u2019s personal representative. 5.6 Distribution Upon Unforeseeable Emergency or Change in Control. In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee may authorize an immediate distribution to the Participant as permitted under Section 409A. In addition, the Committee may terminate and liquidate the Program within 30 days preceding or 12 months after a Change in Control and direct all payments to be made within 12 months of its action to the extent permitted under Section 409A. 7           5.7 Change in Form of Distribution. A Participant may extend the payout period of an installment election or change the form of distribution, not to exceed the maximum payout period of 15 years or such other period determined by the Committee. For purposes of the foregoing, each payment in an installment distribution will be deemed a separate payment and each payout date in an installment distribution election will be treated as a separate election. The election change must be made not less than 12 months prior to Separation from Service and must extend the first distribution payment by at least 5 years, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A. 5.8 Distribution upon Section 409A Failure. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of Sections 5.1 through 5.7, if there is a failure of the Program to satisfy Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 409A\u201d), the Company may in its sole discretion, but is not required to, distribute the portion of the Account of any Participant that must be included in the Participant\u2019s income as a result of the Section 409A failure; provided, however, in no event will a distribution from the Participant\u2019s Diversified Investment Account or the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account exceed the balance of the Participant\u2019s Diversified Investment Account or the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account, respectively, as most recently determined as of the date of distribution. Any such distribution shall be made as soon as is administratively feasible after the Company has both identified the Section 409A failure and determined to make the distribution. No Participant shall be provided the discretion to receive such distribution or a direct or indirect election as to whether the Company will make such distribution. Such distribution from the Participant\u2019s Diversified Investment Account shall be made in one lump sum in cash. Such distribution from the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account shall be made in whole shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, rounded to the closest whole share. Although the Company intends that any such distribution be in shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, notwithstanding any other provision of the Program, the Company reserves the right to pay Stock Units in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock, except for distributions to Section 16 Officers. The number of shares of Common Stock to be distributed will be determined by dividing (a) the dollar value determined as of December 31 of the year of the Section 409A failure of the portion of the Participant\u2019s Company Stock Account determined as of that December 31 to which such Section 409A failure relates, by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as then in effect at the time of distribution. In addition to the tax withholding provided for in Section 5.3, the Company may withhold all federal, state, and local income and employment taxes that may have been previously required as a result of the Section 409A failure. Each Participant is responsible for payment of all taxes, including taxes that are due as a result of any Section 409A failure. The Company has no liability for any Participant\u2019s taxes.\u201d  6. ADMINISTRATION  6.1 Administration. Except to the extent the Committee otherwise designates pursuant to Section 6.2(f), the Committee will control and manage the operation and administration of the Program. 6.2 Committee\u2019s Authority.
