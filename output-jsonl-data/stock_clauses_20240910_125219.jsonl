If the Administrator determines that on a given Exercise Date the number of shares with respect to which Options are to be exercised may exceed: (x) the number of shares then available for sale under the Plan; or (y) the number of shares available for sale under the Plan on the Offering Date(s) of one or more of the Offer Periods in which such Exercise Date is to occur, the Administrator may make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining available for purchase on such Offering Dates or Exercise Date, as applicable, and will either continue the Offer Period then in effect or terminate any one or more Offer Periods then in effect pursuant to Section 19, below. Such allocation method will be \"bottom up,\" with the result that all Option exercises for one (1) share will be satisfied first, followed by all exercises for two (2) shares, and so on, until all available shares have been exhausted. Any amount remaining in a Participant's payroll account following such allocation will be returned to the Participant and will not be carried over to any future Purchase Period or Offer Period, as determined by the Administrator. (b) A Participant will have no interest or voting right in shares covered by the Participant's Option until such shares are actually purchased on the Participant's behalf in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan. No adjustment will be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such purchase. (c) Shares to be delivered to a Participant under the Plan will be registered in the name of the Participant. 8 13. Administration. The Plan will be administered by the Administrator, which will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility, to determine, with respect to each Offer Period, whether the Purchase Price will be determined as of (i) the Exercise Date or (ii) as of the Offering Date or the Exercise Date (whichever is lower), to adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan, and to designate separate Offerings for the eligible Employees of the Company and one or more Designated Parents or Subsidiaries, in which case the Offerings will be considered separate even if the dates of each such Offering are identical and the provisions of the Plan will separately apply to each Offering. Every finding, decision and determination made by the Administrator will, to the full extent permitted by Applicable Law, be final and binding upon all persons.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/cmi-acquisition-llc-12542/contract/166970/#clause-id-341108", "variations": []}
