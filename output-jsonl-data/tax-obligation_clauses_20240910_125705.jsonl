{"clause_number": "Clause 31", "title": "Tax Obligations", "text": "Tax Obligations. (a)Tax Withholding. (i)No Shares will be issued to the Participant until he or she makes satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) for the payment of Tax Withholdings. If the Participant is a non-U.S. employee, the method of payment of Tax Withholdings may be restricted by any Appendix (as defined below). If the Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any Tax Withholdings under this Agreement when any of these RSUs otherwise are supposed to vest or Tax Withholdings related to RSUs otherwise are due, he or she will permanently forfeit the applicable RSUs and any right to receive Shares under such RSUs, and such RSUs will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (ii)The Company has the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Tax Withholdings by withholding from proceeds of a sale of Shares acquired upon payment of these RSUs arranged by the Company (on the Participant's behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), and this will be the method 29 by which such tax withholding obligations are satisfied until the Company determines otherwise, subject to Applicable Laws. (iii)The Company also has the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Tax Withholdings: (a) by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant; (b) by requiring payment by cash or check made payable to the Company and/or any Service Recipient with respect to which the withholding obligation arises; (c) by deduction of such amount from salary, wages or other compensation payable to the Participant; or (d) in any combination of the foregoing, or any other method determined by the Administrator to be compliance with Applicable Laws. (iv)The Company may withhold or account for Tax Withholdings by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in the Participant's jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Common Stock), or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay any additional Tax Withholdings directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Employer(s). If the obligation for Tax Withholdings is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Withholdings. (v)Further, if the Participant is subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, the Company or the Employer(s) or former Employer(s) may withhold or account for tax in more than one jurisdiction. (vi)Regardless of any action of the Company or the Employer(s), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Withholdings and any and all additional taxes related to the Award, the Shares or other amounts or property delivered under the Award and the Participant's participation in the Plan is and remains his or her responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer(s). The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and the Employer(s) (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Withholdings in connection with any aspect of these RSUs and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of these RSUs to reduce or eliminate his or her liability for Tax Withholdings or achieve any particular tax result. (b)Code Section 409A. It is the intent of this Agreement that it and all issuances and benefits to U.S. taxpayers hereunder be exempt or excepted from the requirements of Code Section 409A pursuant to the \"short-term deferral\" exception under Code Section 409A, or otherwise be exempted or excepted from, or comply with, Code Section 409A, 30 so that none of this Agreement, the RSUs provided under this Agreement, or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Code Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or excepted, or to so comply. Each issuance upon settlement of the RSUs under this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). In no event will any member of the Company Group have any liability or obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless Participant for any taxes that may be imposed, or other costs incurred, on Participant as a result of Code Section 409A.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/upstart-holdings-inc-11496/contract/208863/#clause-id-445686", "variations": []}

(b) Tax Withholding and Default Sell-to-Cover Method of Tax Withholding. Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax Obligations.

Depending on the withholding method, the Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for the Tax Withholding Obligation by considering minimum statutory withholding rates or other withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in Participant's jurisdiction, in which case Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the equivalent in Shares. If the Tax Withholding Obligation is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Performance Units, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of satisfying the Tax Withholding Obligation.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/crowdstrike-holdings-inc-8236/contract/217694/#clause-id-469319", "variations": []}
