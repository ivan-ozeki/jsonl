THE COMPANY:                                        IMMERSION CORPORATION                                           By: _________________________Its: President and Chief Executive Officer                                        Address: 2999 N.E. 191st Street, Suite 610                                                Aventura, FL  33180 Email:  ___________________________Facsimile:  ________________________                                          INDEMNITEE:   [Signature] [Print Name] Address:  ____________________________________ Email:  ___________________________Facsimile:  ________________________          16     EX-10.1 2 immr5272022form8-kex101.htm EX-10.1     DocumentINDEMNITY AGREEMENTThis Indemnity Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), dated as of _________, __, 202_, is made by and between Immersion Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), and _________________________ (the \u201cIndemnitee\u201d). RECITALSA. The Company is aware that competent and experienced persons are increasingly reluctant to serve as directors, officers or agents of corporations unless they are protected by comprehensive liability insurance or indemnification, due to increased exposure to litigation costs and risks resulting from their service to such corporations, and due to the fact that the exposure frequently bears no reasonable relationship to the compensation of such directors, officers and other agents. B. The statutes and judicial decisions regarding the duties of directors and officers are often difficult to apply, ambiguous, or conflicting, and therefore fail to provide such directors, officers and agents with adequate, reliable knowledge of legal risks to which they are exposed or information regarding the proper course of action to take. C.     Plaintiffs often seek damages in such large amounts and the costs of litigation may be so enormous (whether or not the case is meritorious), that the defense and/or settlement of such litigation is often beyond the personal resources of directors, officers and other agents. D.     The Company believes that it is unfair for its directors, officers and agents and the directors, officers and agents of its subsidiaries to assume the risk of huge judgments and other expenses which may occur in cases in which the director, officer or agent received no personal profit and in cases where the director, officer or agent was not culpable. E.     The Company recognizes that the issues in controversy in litigation against a director, officer or agent of a corporation such as the Company or its subsidiaries are often related to the knowledge, motives and intent of such director, officer or agent, that he is usually the only witness with knowledge of the essential facts and exculpating circumstances regarding such matters, and that the long period of time which usually elapses before the trial or other disposition of such litigation often extends beyond the time that the director, officer or agent can reasonably recall such matters; and may extend beyond the normal time for retirement for such director, officer or agent with the result that he, after retirement or in the event of his death, his spouse, heirs, executors or administrators, may be faced with limited ability and undue hardship in maintaining an adequate defense, which may discourage such a director, officer or agent from serving in that position. F.     Based upon their experience as business managers, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has concluded that, to retain and attract talented and experienced individuals to serve as directors, officers and agents of the Company and its subsidiaries and to encourage such individuals to take the business risks necessary for the success of the Company and its subsidiaries, it is necessary for the Company to contractually indemnify its directors, officers and agents and the directors, officers and agents of its subsidiaries, and to assume for itself maximum liability for expenses and damages in connection with claims against such directors, officers and agents in connection with their service to the Company and its subsidiaries, and has further concluded that the failure to provide such contractual indemnification could result in great harm to the Company and its subsidiaries and the Company's stockholders. G.     Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, under which the Company is organized (\u201cSection 145\u201d), empowers the Company to indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents by agreement and to indemnify persons who serve, at the request of the Company, as the directors, officers, employees or agents of other corporations or enterprises, and expressly provides that the indemnification provided by Section 145 is not exclusive. H.     This Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder;I.     Indemnitee has certain rights to indemnification and/or insurance provided by _______ which Indemnitee and ___________ intend to be secondary to the primary obligation of the Company to indemnify Indemnitee as provided herein, with the Company\u2019s acknowledgement and agreement to the foregoing being a material condition to Indemnitee\u2019s willingness to serve on the Board;J. The Company desires and has requested the Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve as a director, officer or agent of the Company and/or one or more subsidiaries of the Company free from undue concern for claims for damages arising out of or related to such services to the Company and/or one or more subsidiaries of the Company. K.     Indemnitee is willing to serve, or to continue to serve, the Company and/or one or more subsidiaries of the Company, provided that he is furnished the indemnity provided for herein.
