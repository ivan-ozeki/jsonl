The parties acknowledge and agree that it shall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to condition Landlord\u2019s consent to any proposed Alteration on Tenant delivering to Landlord an additional sum to be added to the Security Deposit in the amount of the reasonably estimated costs of removing such Alteration upon the Expiration Date as reasonably determined by Landlord\u2019s contractor, but in no event to exceed three months of Base Rent.
