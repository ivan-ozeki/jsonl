{"clause_number": "Clause 36", "title": "Waiver of Notice", "text": "Waiver of Notice. Subject to Sections 1(b) and (c), Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of intent to accelerate, notices of acceleration, notices of any suit or any other action against Borrower or any other person, any other notices to any party liable on the Indebtedness (including Guarantor), notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional Indebtedness. 2 9. Waivers of Other Rights and Defenses. (a) Guarantor waives any rights and defenses that are or may become available to Guarantor by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code. (b) Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that Guarantor may have because any of the Indebtedness is secured by real property. This means, among other things: (i) Lender may collect from Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower; and (ii) if Lender forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by Borrower: (1) the amount of the Indebtedness may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) Lender may collect from Guarantor even if Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Guarantor may have because any of the Indebtedness is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. (c) Guarantor waives any right or defense it may have at law or equity, including California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a, to a fair market value hearing or action to determine a deficiency judgment after a foreclosure.", "found_in": "https://contracts.justia.comhttps://contracts.justia.com/companies/determine-inc-2034/contract/337014/#clause-id-729413", "variations": []}
