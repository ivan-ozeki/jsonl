(iii) below). In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:1.Separation Date, Accrued Amounts and Separation Benefits. Executive\u2019s employment with Landec Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) will end effective March 12, 2021 (the \u201cSeparation Date\u201d). Executive acknowledges that the Company has paid Executive in a single lump-sum payment on the Separation Date any earned, but unpaid, base salary and accrued, but unused paid vacation to which she is entitled through the Separation Date (collectively the \u201cAccrued Amounts\u201d). If Executive signs this Agreement no earlier than the Separation Date and no later than the 22nd day after she receives it (the \u201cOffer Period\u201d), the Company shall provide Executive with the separation benefits described in Sections 1(a) through (d) below (collectively the \u201cSeparation Benefits\u201d) provided this Agreement becomes effective and enforceable. All payments made by the Company under this Agreement shall be reduced by any tax or other amounts required to be withheld by the Company under applicable law. (a)Severance Payment. The Company shall pay Executive the amount of $309,000, which sum represents twelve (12) months\u2019 of her current base salary (such amount to be paid in equal installments on the Company\u2019s regularly scheduled payroll dates), with the first payment, which shall be retroactive to the day immediately following the Separation Date, being due and payable on the Company\u2019s next regular payday for executives that follows the expiration of thirty (30) days from the Separation Date. If the Executive signs the Agreement on the Separation Date, and does not subsequently revoke the Agreement, the first payday under the Agreement will be on the following regularly scheduled payroll pay date. (b)Bonus. The Company shall pay Executive the annual incentive award to which she is entitled, if any, under the Incentive Plan (as such term is defined in the Executive Employment Agreement between Executive and the Company dated January 31, 2019 (the \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d)) for the Company\u2019s 2021 fiscal year, based on actual performance (disregarding any requirement that Executive be employed through the end of the determination period or on the date the payment is made), and pro-rated through the Separation Date, which shall be paid at the same time bonuses for such year are paid to active employees under the terms of the applicable cash bonus plan (but no later than March 15, 2022).(c)Equity. The Executive\u2019s outstanding Company compensatory equity awards shall vest as follows:(i)     The stock options granted to Executive on October 12, 2018 and July 23, 2020 shall vest and become exercisable, as of the Separation Date but subject to the effectiveness of this Agreement, as to the number of shares that would have vested had Executive remained employed during the 12-month period following the Separation Date (rounded down to the nearest whole share).

(ii)     The restricted stock unit awards granted to Executive on October 12, 2018 and October 15, 2019 will vest, as of the Separation Date but subject to the effectiveness of this Agreement, as to the number of shares that would have vested monthly over the applicable vesting period from the date of grant until the first anniversary of the Separation Date (rounded down to the nearest whole share). Any options and restricted stock units not vested as of the Separation Date (after taking into account Section 1(c)(i) and (ii)) are forfeited automatically in accordance with the terms of the applicable stock incentive plan and related stock option agreements. Executive acknowledges that IRS regulations require that any Incentive Stock Options (ISO) not exercised within 90 days following the Separation Date will become Nonqualified Stock Options for taxing and reporting purposes. (d)Cobra. During the period commencing on the Separation Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the maximum period permitted under COBRA and (ii) the date on which Executive becomes eligible for coverage under the group health plan of a subsequent employer (of which eligibility Executive hereby agrees to give prompt notice to the Company) (in any case, the \u201cCOBRA Period\u201d), the Company shall reimburse Executive, with respect to each month during the COBRA Period, an amount equal to the monthly premium actually paid by Executive for such continued healthcare coverage; provided, that in no event shall such reimbursement amount exceed the cost actually paid by Executive for such continued healthcare coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (x) any plan pursuant to which such benefits are provided is not, or ceases prior to the expiration of the period of continuation coverage to be, exempt from the application of Section 409A (as defined below) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(a)(5), or (y) the Company is otherwise unable to continue to cover Executive under its group health plans without incurring penalties (including without limitation, pursuant to Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), then, in either case, each remaining premium payment under this Section 1(d) shall thereafter be paid to Executive in substantially equal monthly installments over the COBRA Period (or the remaining portion thereof). To be eligible for this benefit, Executive may be required to make a valid and timely election to continue healthcare coverage under the Company\u2019s group health plans pursuant to Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of  1986, as amended and the regulations thereunder (i.e., by electing COBRA). In addition, Executive may be required to provide complete and accurate documentation evidencing her actual premium payments for continued healthcare coverage in order to receive reimbursement from the Company pursuant to this Section 1. (e)Resignations. Effective as of the Separation Date, Executive hereby resigns as Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Chief People Officer of the Company and any other officer or board positions that she may hold with any other affiliate of the Company.22.General Release.

(a)Waiver of California Civil Code Section 1542. Executive also acknowledges that she has been advised of California Civil Code Section 1542, which reads as follows:  3A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.Executive agrees that she is waiving any and all rights she may have under California Civil Code Section 1542 with respect to the general release of claims in Section 2 of this Agreement. In connection with this waiver, she acknowledges that she may hereafter discover claims presently unknown or unsuspected, or facts in addition to or different from those which she may now know or believe to be true, with respect to the claims released pursuant to Section 2. Nevertheless, she intends to and does by this Agreement release, fully, finally and forever, in the manner described in Section 2, all such claims as provided therein. This Agreement shall constitute the full and absolute release of all claims and rights released in this Agreement, notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any additional or different claims or facts relating thereto.

Executive understands that the general release set forth in Section 2 above includes a release of any claims she may have, if any, against the Released Parties under the ADEA.

Executive acknowledges that she has been given a period of at least twenty-one (21) days from the date this Agreement was initially delivered to her to decide whether to sign this Agreement (the \u201cConsideration Period\u201d). If she decides to sign this Agreement before the expiration of the Consideration Period, which is solely her choice, she represents that her decision is knowing and voluntary. She agrees that any revisions made to this Agreement after it was initially delivered to her were either not material or were requested by her, and do not re-start the Consideration Period. Executive has been advised to consult with an attorney of her own choosing prior to signing this Agreement. (iii)     Revocation Period; Effective Date. Executive understands that she may revoke this Agreement within seven (7) days after she has signed it (the \u201cRevocation Period\u201d).
